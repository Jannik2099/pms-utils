.. currentmodule:: pms_utils.ebuild

| This class provides the metadata values of a given ebuild as implemented by Portage's md5-cache.
| It does **not** implement the PMS metadata cache as per `PMS 14 <https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/8/pms.html#x1-15100014>`_, because no tooling appears to use it these days.
